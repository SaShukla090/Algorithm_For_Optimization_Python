# Algorithms for Optimization in Python

This repository contains the **Python** translations of **Ruby** code examples from the book [*Algorithms for Optimization*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262039420/algorithms-for-optimization) by **Mykel J. Kochenderfer** and **Tim A. Wheeler**.

## Inspiration

The original code in the book is written in Ruby. My goal is to make the examples more accessible to **Python** enthusiasts and the open-source community. By providing a Python-based reference, I hope to help others learn, experiment with, and implement algorithms from this excellent resource.
